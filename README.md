## React Fasting App

React Fasting App is a web application designed to help users track their health and fitness progress. This app provides a variety of features to help users manage their fasting journey and maintain a healthy lifestyle.

# Features

1. **Quiz Page:** The app starts with a quiz that guides users through a series of questions with different variants. This information is essential for tailoring the fasting and health recommendations provided by the app.

2. **Context Management:** The app employs a context system to store and manage the user's responses to the quiz questions, ensuring that previous variants are saved for reference and further customization.

3. **Height and Weight Pages:** Users can input their height and weight, and the app offers a switcher to toggle between metric and imperial units, enabling users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) easily.

4. **BMI Results Page:** Based on the height, weight, and other user-provided information, the app calculates the user's BMI and classifies it into one of four categories: UNDERWEIGHT, NORMAL, OVERWEIGHT, or OBESE. Additionally, it provides detailed descriptions for each BMI category.

5. **Progress Bars:** The app features a progress bar that dynamically reflects the user's BMI category. This allows users to monitor their health progress at a glance.

6. **Routing and Communication:** The app includes routing for all pages, allowing users to navigate seamlessly between the quiz, question variants, height and weight input, and results page. It also implements communication between components to provide a smooth and interactive user experience.

7. **Navigation:** Users can move between 13 different pages in the app, including the quiz, question variants, height and weight input, and results page. The app includes a "Step Back" button component that makes it easy for users to return to the previous step in the process.
